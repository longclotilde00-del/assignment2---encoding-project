Encoding project : François Truffaut's letters

The materials I chose are three letters written by François Truffaut, a french director from the New Wave, adressed to collaborators and friends from french cinema. The three letters intertwined professional discussions and amical notes on cinema, thus reflecting complex relationships as colleagues and friends, enthusiasts and professionals.

I selected these three letters because they give us an intimate glimpse into the lives of cinema figures from the 1950s and because they witness the bonds forged around making movies. Furthermore, these letters are interesting because they are annotated in Francois Truffaut's own handwriting, combining typewritten text with later handwritten notes, which give us an insight into the director's train of thought as he wrote.

This point precisely explains why XML can help structure and enrich my project, since the use of XML can clarify this intermingling of handwritten notes and typewritten text, with the presence of additions, deletions, underlining and marginal notes. XML uses metadata to explain the context common to the three letters, that of French cinema at the time, and their differences in creation, publication, and writing. The structure provided by XML can thus enrich the project by highlighting the different types of relationships that F. Truffaut had with his collaborators and can produce historical knowledge related to cinema at that time. 

Drawing inspiration from TEI guidelines, I organized my XML file into two main sections—metadata and text—while adapting element names to better fit the specificities of my corpus. Although influenced by TEI, my encoding choices remain simplified and customized, allowing the DTD to accommodate the particular features of each letter.

I used generative AI to help me understand how Oxygen works and the errors found.
