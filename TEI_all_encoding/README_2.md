encoding project : François Truffaut's letters

For this encoding project using the TEI all schema, I kept the same samples as for the XML encoding validated with the DTD, except for one of the three letters. I have selected three letters sent by François Truffaut to three of his friends and colleagues in the film industry: Jean Gruault, Georges Delerue, and Alfred Hitchcock. These letters provide insight into the relationships that existed between various figures in the film industry in the 1960s and 1970s. Above all, they provide insight into Francois Truffaut's writing style, as two of them contain handwritten annotations and corrections.

Encoding these letters in XML is a way of clarifying their context and thus comparing their creation and content. Furthermore, XML makes it possible to clarify this intermingling of handwritten notes and typed text and make it explicit. This time, my project is encoded in XML and validated against the TEI all schema based on the TEI guidelines. 
For encoding my first letter, I developed as much as possible the TEI header containing the text metadata. For example, I have integrated a thesaurus of people and places so that they can be referenced in the metadata and in the encoding of the text. I also developed the physical description sections to describe the differences in writing (handwritten, typed). I have also included the changes made to my encoding and their date so that they can be easily identified. Finally, the metadata contains elements from the TEI schema that are specific to the letter format, such as correspdesc, which describes the action associated with the letter.
The encoding of the body text explains the common structure of a letter with an opener, dateline, paragraphs, signature, etc. I added the changes of hand for the writing mode as well as annotations and a deletion at the signature.
I used gen AI to help me understand the use of certain TEI elements.
